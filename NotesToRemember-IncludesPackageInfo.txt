== Package installs ==

	npm install --save express
	
	npm install -g nodemon
		(the -g makes it global, so you can run from any directory you want)
		
	npm install --save socket.io


== Notes ==
* The following allows use of "npm start"
	  "scripts":{
		"start": "node index"
	  }
* Or, you can install nodemon, and just say "nodemon" (no arguments needed).
* I don't think anything in the package.json is needed for nodemon?
* socket.broadcast to send to everyone except a particular socket.
  io.emit to send to EVERYONE.
