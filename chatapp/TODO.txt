== Have to implement: ==
* Basic responsive design.
* Make user list scrollable.
* "The nickname should be indicated to the user, 
  for example by being displayed at the top of the page 
  as suggested in the proposed layout."
* Error if someone snatched your username while you were disconnected.
* See the next section

== Done, But Improvable ==
* (Sorta-DONE!) Timestamps (calculated by the server)
	- DONE! But maybe add date, too?
	- Finally, note that getUTCMonth is 0-11, while getUTCFullYear and getUTCDate are "properly" indexed.
	- (SKIP FOR NOW) Could also add a "Today" and a "Yesterday" feature, but that may need an event at midnight UTC? And that would need setTimeout?
	- (SKIP FOR NOW) Also, doing the "Today", "Yesterday", etc. would make it easier to store the date info in html tag as "data-" custom attributes.
* (SORTA-DONE!) User-posted messages are bolded (not so much a feature as an assignment requirement...)

== Testing ==
* Supports 5+ concurrent users at a time.
* Tested to work in both Chrome and Firefox. [I'll try to test Edge wherever possible. Safari and Internet Explorer are probably on their own...]

Finally, the following is a note to myself to make sure it works on the lab's Linux computers.
I will have plenty of time to test this on the weekend, given that the University owns me and I live nowhere else.

== Done ==
* (DONE!) Unique nicknames upon connection
* (DONE!) Bottom-aligning of text (this is supposed to be challenging!) and a scroll bar
* (DONE!) History
	- (DONE!) Memory of at least the last 200 messages. This is probably better to do in memory than on disk, given that this is just a school assignment...
	- (DONE!) The entire remembered chat log is displayed to the user upon connection
* (DONE!) List of all online users. Instantly updated for all users whenever someone joins/disconnects.
* (DONE!) Changing of nicknames using the /nick <new nickname> command
	- (DONE!) Command is refused, WITH ERROR MESSAGE, if the nickname is not unique
	- (DONE!) Nickname change produces instant refresh for all users, making the change visible to all of them
* (DONE!) Change of nickname colour via /nickcolor RRGGBB command
	- (DONE!) Command is refused, WITH ERROR MESSAGE, if wrong format
	- (DONE!) Again, change is instantly shown to all users...
	- (SKIP FOR NOW) Check if colour is too dark?
* Persistence via Cookies.
	- If a user disconnects, then reconnects, they keep their nickname.

	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/208105/how-do-i-remove-a-property-from-a-javascript-object
	- Have a socketID->userID map, updated on connection AND disconnection.
	- Parse the cookie for the userID
	- On client side:	document.cookie = "userID=_";
	- Etc.
