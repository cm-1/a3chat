Have to implement:
* Basic responsive design.
* (Sorta-DONE!) Timestamps (calculated by the server)
	- DONE! But maybe add date, too?
	- Could also add a "Today" and a "Yesterday" feature, but that may need an event at midnight UTC? And that would need setTimeout?
	- Also, doing the "Today", "Yesterday", etc. would make it easier to store the date info in html tag as "data-" custom attributes.
	- Finally, note that getUTCMonth is 0-11, while getUTCFullYear and getUTCDate are "properly" indexed.
* List of all online users. Instantly updated for all users whenever someone joins/disconnects.
	- Make sure it's scrollable;
* Changing of nicknames using the /nick <new nickname> command
	- Command is refused if the nickname is not unique
	- Nickname change produces instant refresh for all users, making the change visible to all of them
* Change of nickname colour via /nickcolor RRGGBB command
	- Again, change is instantly shown to all users...
	- Check if colour is too dark?
* User-posted messages are bolded (not so much a feature as an assignment requirement...)
* Persistence via Cookies.
	- If a user disconnects, then reconnects, they keep their nickname.
* Supports 5+ concurrent users at a time.
* Tested to work in both Chrome and Firefox. [I'll try to test Edge wherever possible. Safari and Internet Explorer are probably on their own...]
Finally, the following is a note to myself to make sure it works on the lab's Linux computers.
I will have plenty of time to test this on the weekend, given that the University owns me and I live nowhere else.

== Done ==
* (DONE!) Unique nicknames upon connection
* (DONE!) Bottom-aligning of text (this is supposed to be challenging!) and a scroll bar
* (DONE!) History
	- Memory of at least the last 200 messages. This is probably better to do in memory than on disk, given that this is just a school assignment...
	- The entire remembered chat log is displayed to the user upon connection
